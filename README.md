# QutieHack2018Project
This project is a 24hr binary clock. It shows HH:MM at delay 60000. It can be manipulated to be MM:SS if the delay is changed to 1000. This project uses 1 Arduino UNO with 13 pins, 13 leds, 13 resistors @ 320 Ohms, 1 breadboard, lots of wires.

This project was made during Qutie Hack 2018. More information can be found at https://devpost.com/software/arduino-uno-binary-clock
